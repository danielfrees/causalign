# `out` directory

Storage for train/val predictions for experiments, as well as evaluation metrics 
for experiments. 

Search for experiments by f-string of critical hyperparameters (TODO: determine which 
hyperparameters we want as our axes for analysis and plotting later. Definitely 
lr, treatment phrase, architecture settings, base model, dataset, lambdas, etc.)
